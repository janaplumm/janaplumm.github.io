            <h3>Empowering underprivileged South African youth with entrepreneurial education</h3>
            <p>In 2021, South Africa recorded the highest youth unemployment rate in the world, with young people aged
                15 to 24 accounting for over half of the total unemployment rate. During an international summer
                exchange in Denmark, our group developed a dual-approach business model to
                address this issue.</p>

                <p>During the 3-week course, 'An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship', at the Copenhagen Business
                    School, work in teams on a specific social entrepreneurship problem based on one of the <b>17

                <p>Our group of five was an <b>internationally diverse team</b>, with each member representing a

                    Australia (technically, I also represented Germany), England, Denmark, South Africa, and the United
                    States. Our undergraduate backgrounds were
                    also different, ranging across business, design, law, and marketing.</p>
                <p>This diversity proved incredibly useful, as it allowed for <b>multiple perspectives</b> and being
                    able to divide the workload according to our <b>unique strengths</b>.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Our South African team member encouraged us to explore <b>South Africa</b> as a focal point, given

            <section class="collapisble-content">
                <p>Individually, we completed <b>desktop research</b> to better understand South Africa's history and
                    present
                    problems in relation to education. This research was in the form of academic papers, recent news
                    articles, and statistical data from places like The World Bank and the United Nations Children's
                    Fund (UNICEF). We summarised all research in a shared document to avoid any overlapping information.
                </p>
                <h5>Key Issues</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Despite abolishment in 1994, Apartheid's long-lasting effects of socio-economic inequality and
                        deep-rooted racism still affect the nation today</li>
                    <li>In 2023, poverty affects 47% of Black South African households compared with 1% of Indian,
                        Asian, and White South African households</li>
                    <li>Amnesty International outlined that poor infrastructure, untrained teachers, and safety issues
                        gravely affect the education system in a 2020 report</li>
                    <li>South Africa's education system is consistently ranked amongst the worst globally</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Issue Tree</h5>
                <p>In order to break down the societal problem of quality education, we asked ourselves, <b>"Why is the
                        education system in South Africa broken?"</b>, and formed connections with the researched issues
                    of corruption, poverty, and the long-lasting effects of apartheid through an issue tree.</p>

                <h5>Inclusion of SDG 8</h5>
                <p>After completing our desktop research and issue tree, we decided to focus on the relationship between
                    the cycle of unemployment and the poor education system. Therefore, we added the UN's eigth SDG of
                    <b>decent work and economic growth</b> to our business model.

                <p>Given the short project time frame, we had to ideate quickly and efficiently. This led us to use the
                    <b>reverse idea generation</b> (also known as worst possible idea) and
                    <b>brainstorming</b> methods.

                    <li>Collectively imagined the worst ideas to contribute to the regression of South Africa's
                        education system.</li>
                    <li>Voted on the top three ideas, with the most votes going to the concept of 'theoretical education
                        only with no practical skills taught'.</li>
                    <li>Used this as an anchor to start brainstorming solution ideas to address this worst possible
                        idea.</li>

            <section class="collapisble-content">
                <p>Our final solution was influenced by <b>work integration social enterprises (WISEs)</b>. WISEs help
                    unemployed individuals with low qualifications who face societal exclusion from the labour
                    market. With our target group aged 16-25, we focused on providing them with <b>practical skills
                        for self-employment</b>.</p>
                <p>Our social enterprise is called <b>Kasi Kollektive</b>. 'Kasi' is Afrikaans slang for
                    'lokasie,'
                    meaning townships. These townships are historically marginalised communities and home to our target
                    demographic.</p>
                <p>People living in South African townships are unlikely to have access to quality education. Our
                    <b>business model</b> is based on a dual approach that uses educational
                    business development courses to help struggling young South Africans with an entrepreneurial
                    spirit launch their own product or service via our <b>e-commerce platform</b>, Kasi Kollektive. We
                    envision designing these <b>business courses</b> through a partnership with one or two Universities.
                </p>
                <h5>Key Characteristics:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Accredited business development course in partnership with a university and its students.</li>
                    <li>Our beneficiary Kasi Kollektive students are tutored and mentored by selected university
                        students.</li>
                    <li>The course will also be available free of charge via the Kasi Kollektive e-commerce platform.
                    </li>
                    <li>Upon course completion, beneficiaries can apply to feature their proposed business on the
                        e-commerce platform.</li>
                    <li>Similar to the Grameen Bank model, we would only be able to accept product- or service-ready
                        businesses.</li>
                    <li>Revenue will come from sales and donations through Kasi Kollektive, with income reinvested into
                        the company.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Visual Communication</h5>
                <p>Creating visual assets or mockups was not required, but as the sole design student on the team, I
                    developed several designs to <b>visually communicate</b> our concept. This included an inspiration
                    <b>mood board</b>, a <b>logo</b> with tagline, and two <b>website mockups</b> of what Kasi
                    Kollektive could look like. I found that
                    these assets played a key role in setting our project apart from the rest of the cohort based on
                    tutor and peer feedback.

                <p>Our proposed social enterprise, Kasi Kollektive, ended up receiving a top ten nomination at the
                    <a href="https://www.seizmic.eu/awards" target="_blank">2023 SEIZMIC Awards</a>, a competition
                    involving nine European universities and co-founded by the European Union. While we did not win, we were
                    incredibly proud to have earned a nomination spot.

                <h5>Key Learning Lessons</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gained insight into how social enterprises can succeed, such as the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh and the Ruby Cup in Kenya.</li>
                    <li>Explored tools, such as the Kannampuzha and Hockerts measurement scale, and frameworks, like The Wharton Societal Impact Program.</li>
                    <li>Expanded my understanding of social organisational structures, including co-operative societies and community interest companies.</li>
                    <li>Reflected on ethical issues, such as the White Savior Industrial Complex (WSIC), often found in humanitarian work.</li>
