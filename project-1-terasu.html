                <p>After conducting an initial brainstorm, we decided to choose <b>SDG 8</b>, which pertains to promote

                <p>After consulting with our peers and tutor, we chose to direct our attention to the key insight of
                    "career starters <b>need to feel confident</b> in being able to express their authentic selves
                    during the job hunt". This enabled us to start designing for this particular user need. The design
                    process involved <b>three iterations</b>, resulting in numerous brainstorming and ideation sessions
                    over the course of 12 weeks.</p>
                <h5>Overview</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>After conducting our research and reframing our original problem statement, we arrived at
                        <b>four initial concepts</b> that were presented for feedback
                    </li>
                    <li>Using a <b>design critique</b>, we adapted the feedback and applied various methods, such as
                        systems mapping, mood boarding and sketching</li>
                    <li>We created our first <b>low-fidelity prototype</b> for a concept titled <b>CoMEtted</b></li>
                    <li>We developed the prototype and following three rounds of <b>user testing</b>, we arrived at our
                        final concept called <b>terasu</b></li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Early Stage: Initial Concept and Brainstorming</h5>
                <p>Below are snippets of the early stage process, including <b>my first concept idea</b> and a <b>group
                        whiteboarding session</b>. Inspired by the Worst Possible Idea method, my first concept idea
                    involved an avatar manifestation experience called Build Your Future Self. Our group design critique
                    of our four concepts led to creating a whole new concept.</p>
                <div class="collapsible-images">

                    <img src="images/project-1-terasu/terasu-brainstorm.jpeg"
                        alt="Slide summarising key insights from research">
                </div>
                <h5>Intermediate Stage: Design Methods and Testable Concept</h5>
                <p>We explored the new concept through mood boarding, brainstorming, mind mapping and sketches. Our
                    tutor introduced us to <b>systems thinking</b>. The systems map proved to be an invaluable tool, as
                    it
                    allowed a birds eye perspective of the interconnected relationships between the stakeholder groups
                    within our problem space.</p>
                <p>From there, we developed <b>CoMEtted</b>, a three-part physical and digital experience with the aim
                    of
                    inspiring users to self-reflect and motivate themselves to build their soft skills and confidence.
                    The name is a play on 'me' and 'committed'. CoMEtted involves <b>three components</b> that make up
                    separate
                    experiences: A smart mirror, a motivational wall with quote projections and an app. The mirror
                    offers a reflection activity, while the wall offers a sense of community. These would be situated on
                    educational campuses. The app allows users to
                    engage withCoMEtted on a more long-term,personalised basis to set goals in line with soft skills and
                    assign a buddy to hold themselves accountable.
                </p>
                <p>Below is a screenshot of the systems map in FigJam, as well as the sketch of our first testable
                    concept, CoMEtted.</p>

                </div>
                <h5>End Stage: Design Principles and Final Concept</h5>
                <p>After <b>three rounds of user testing</b>, we arrived at our final design concept. This included
                    several
                    iterations and a <b>name change</b>. User testing revealed confusion around the name 'CoMEtted',
                    especially
                    from international students, and this led to the more abstract name of <b>'terasu'</b>. terasu means
                    'to shine' in Japanese and is inspired by the myth of the Japanese sun goddess,
                    <a href="https://naokoyogitakiguchi.medium.com/when-the-sun-goddess-hid-in-the-cave-of-heaven-a-medicine-story-from-japanese-creation-myths-30b166125c32"
                        target="_blank">Amaterasu</a> .
                </p>
                <p>terasu offers a <b>more simplified, purposeful</b> experience compared to CoMEtted. Instead of three
                    separate components, the wall of motivation and the mirror became one installation. Rather than
                    being a smart mirror, it now acts as a symbol for self-reflection. The app was adapted to involve
                    mentorship from industry professionals rather than a buddy for accountability. This resulted in two
                    apps, one for career starters and one for mentors. This is similar to how Uber has one for drivers
                    and one for passengers.</p>
                <p>Below are excerpts from our final report, highlighting the underpinning <b>design principles</b> of
                    terasu, as well as the <b>iterative process overview</b>:</p>

            <section class="collapisble-content">
                <p>User testing was not just <b>vital</b> for the final outcome, but for the entire process. It enabled
                    us to
                    gain a <b>better understanding</b> of our target audience and their needs. It also <b>uncovered
                        issues</b> that
                    we, as designers, were less likely to detect due to our own bias.</p>
                <h5>First Round</h5>
                <p>We tested a <b>low-fidelity</b> version of CoMEtted using a comprehensive <b>testing protocol</b>, which
                    involved the think aloud method, interviewing and a survey. Our analysis of the quantitative and
                    qualitative data revealed important insights, including a need for clarity, personalisation and
                    enhanced interactions.</p>

                <h5>Second Round</h5>
                <p>We tested a <b>mid-fidelity</b> version of terasu in a lecture theatre using projectors to mimic the wall of
                    motivation. The improved fidelity of the prototype allowed for participants to feel more immersed in
                    the experience. While the second user testing round <b></b>showed clear improvements</b> from the first round,
                    we <b>uncovered new problems</b>. These were more specific towards the transition from the physical
                    experience to the digital experience. Also, the app onboarding process was too long and still included the
                    buddy system.</p>
                <p>The final user test involved a <b>heuristic evaluation</b> of the app, carried out by group member Morgan.</p>
                <p>Below are photos from the second round of testing. The first photo is from a technical test to ensure the projected wall worked as desired. The second photo shows me introducing the test to a participant.</p>
