            <h3>Visual communication and design futuring for a good cause</h3>
            <p>Since 1999, non-profit organisation M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF) has led the Access Campaign to promote
                vaccine access and awareness. This solo project employed design futuring and graphic narratives to
                develop a timescape and a social media call-to-action initiative.</p>

                    This project involved <b>desktop research</b> on visual communication fields, including
                    Gestalt theory and typography, and an in-depth study of <b>MSF's brand</b>, and <b>social media
                        marketing strategies</b>.</p>
                <h5>Overview</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Studied the social media and volunteering habits of the target group (18-35 year olds).</li>
                    <li>Investigated MSF's prior Access Campaign strategies and their impact (such as changing laws).
                    </li>
                    <li>Researched current social media trends, particularly regarding Instagram.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Ideation</h5>
                <p>While most of my research was contained in word documents, I did create a basic <b>mood
                        board</b> to summarise
                    findings regarding the target audience. I also used the <b>Crazy Eights</b> design sprint method to
                    inspire a few
                    ideas for the Instagram post while the research was fresh in my memory.

            <button class="collapsible-button"> Timescape ‚è≥</button>
            <section class="collapisble-content">
                <p>Prior to designing the Instagram tiles, I created a <b>timescape</b> using <b>Adobe Illustrator</b> to
                    visualise a potential future for MSF. Futures are unpredictable, yet we constantly try to strategise
                    for them. This design
                    methodology is backed by research and helps strategise by visually laying out a
                    <b>roadmap of
                        potential outcomes</b>.
                </p>
                <p>I found this design methodology particularly compelling, because, as designers, it is imperative to
                        consider consequences. Timescapes are not a crystal ball for the future, but a
                    <b>strategic
                        tool</b> to understand the purpose of a design and striving for the <b>best possible
                        outcome</b>.
                </p>
                <p>My timescape made it into my professor's <b>academic paper on design futuring</b>.
                    <a href="https://jfsdigital.org/articles-and-essays/2024-2/vol-28-no-4-june-2024/futuring-visual-communication-pedagogy-two-visual-thinking-tools-for-applied-design-futuring/"

            <section class="collapisble-content">
                <p>The timescape made me <b>reflect more deeply</b> about the kind of Instagram campaign I would want to
                    create based on the timescape's potential futures.
                </p>
                <p>Below are the final Instagram tiles, which are based on several <b>strategic design
                        choices</b>. Similar to the timescape, they are hand-drawn in Adobe Illustrator.
                </p>
                <h5>Design Choices</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Employed the communicative tool of digital messaging to connect to the target audience (18-35
                        year olds).</li>
                    <li>Research supported that texting and emojis can boost moods and improve relationships.</li>
                    <li>Usage of cartoon aesthetic ignites the fun appeal based on study of six primary engagement
                        appeals.</li>
                    <li>Colour palette blends MSF colour scheme with Very Peri, Pantone's 2022 colour of the year, to
                        appeal to Gen Z's interest in trends.</li>
                    <li>Social media campaigns utilising human faces are more successful in audience engagement
                        according to research.</li>
                    <li>Combined MSF photographs with 'doodle-bomb' illustrations inspired by artist Hattie Stewart.</li>
                    <li>There is a clear storyline tying the four tiles together, which is also illustrated by a dotted
                        squiggly line.</li>
                </ul>

                </div>
                <h5>Instagram Caption</h5>
                <p>And, finally, an eye-catching Instagram visual needs an equally engaging caption to go with it.
                    I used
                    a <b>light-hearted, playful tone</b>, and <b>emojis</b> to grab the viewer's attention along with
                    facts to underline the serious and important nature of the post.
