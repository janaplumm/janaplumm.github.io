            <h3>Empowering underprivileged South African youth with entrepreneurial education</h3>
            <p>In 2021, South Africa recorded the highest youth unemployment rate in the world, with young people aged
                15 to 24 accounting for over half of the total unemployment rate. During an international summer
                exchange in Denmark, our group developed a dual-approach business model to
                address this issue.</p>

                <p>During the 3-week course, 'An Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship', at the Copenhagen Business
                    School, work in teams on a specific social entrepreneurship problem based on one of the <b>17

                <p>Our group of five was an <b>internationally diverse team</b>, with each member representing a
                    different country:
                    Australia (technically, I also represented Germany), England, Denmark, South Africa, and the United
                    States. Our undergraduate backgrounds were
                    also different, ranging across business, design, law, and marketing.</p>
                <p>This diversity proved incredibly useful, as it allowed for <b>multiple perspectives</b> and being
                    able to divide the workload according to our <b>unique strengths</b>.</p>

                <p>Our group was formed prior to the course, because we connected over our shared goal of promoting
                    <b>quality education</b>, the fourth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of the United Nations (UN).
                </p>
                <p>Our South African team member encouraged us to explore <b>South Africa</b> as a focal point, given
                    his first-hand experiences with the local education system.</p>

            <section class="collapisble-content">
                <p>Individually, we completed <b>desktop research</b> to better understand South Africa's history and present
                    problems in relation to education. This research was collected through written documents and shared
                    amongst the group in our communication channel.</p>
                <h5>Key Issues</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Despite abolishment in 1994, Apartheid's long-lasting effects of socio-economic inequality and deep-rooted racism still affect the nation today</li>
                    <li>In 2023, poverty affects 47% of Black South African households compared with 1% of Indian, Asian, and White South African households</li>
                    <li>Amnesty International outlined that poor infrastructure, untrained teachers, and safety issues gravely affect the education system in a 2020 report</li>
                    <li>South Africa's education system is consistently ranked amongst the worst globally</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Issue Tree</h5>
                <p>In order to break down the societal problem of quality education, we asked ourselves, <b>"Why is the
                        education system in South Africa broken?"</b>, and formed connections with the researched issues
                    of corruption, poverty, and the long-lasting effects of apartheid through an issue tree.</p>

                <h5>Inclusion of SDG 8</h5>
                <p>After completing our desktop research and issue tree, we decided to focus on the relationship between
                    the cycle of unemployment and the poor education system. Therefore, we added the UN's eigth SDG of
                    <b>decent work and economic growth</b> to our business model.
