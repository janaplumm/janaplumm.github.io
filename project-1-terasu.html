                <p>After conducting an initial brainstorm, we decided to choose <b>SDG 8</b>, which pertains to

                <p>After consulting with our peers and tutor, we chose to direct our attention to the key insight of
                    "career starters <b>need to feel confident</b> in being able to express their authentic selves
                    during the job hunt". This allowed us to begin designing for this specific user need. The design
                    process involved <b>three iterations</b>, resulting in numerous brainstorming and ideation sessions
                    over the course of 12 weeks.</p>
                <h5>Overview</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>After conducting research and reframing our original problem statement, we arrived at
                        <b>four initial concepts</b> that were presented for feedback.
                    </li>
                    <li>Using a <b>design critique</b>, we adapted the feedback and applied various methods, such as
                        systems mapping, mood boarding, and sketching.</li>
                    <li>We created our first <b>low-fidelity prototype</b> for a concept titled <b>CoMEtted.</b></li>
                    <li>We developed the prototype and following three rounds of <b>user testing</b>, we arrived at our
                        final concept, called <b>terasu</b>.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Early Stage: Initial Concept and Brainstorming</h5>
                <p>Below are snippets of the early stage process, including <b>my first concept idea</b> and a <b>group
                        whiteboarding session</b>. Inspired by the worst possible idea method, my first concept idea
                    involved an avatar manifestation experience called Build Your Future Self. Our group design critique
                    of our four concepts led to creating a whole new concept.</p>

                        alt="Photo of our group whiteboarding brainstorming session">
                </div>
                <h5>Intermediate Stage: Design Methods and Testable Concept</h5>
                <p>We explored the new concept through mood boarding, brainstorming, mind mapping, and sketches. Our
                    tutor introduced us to <b>systems thinking</b>. The systems map proved to be an invaluable tool, as
                    it gave us a bird's-eye view of the interconnected relationships between the stakeholder groups
                    within our problem space.</p>
                <p>From there, we developed <b>CoMEtted</b>, a three-part physical and digital experience with the aim
                    of
                    inspiring users to self-reflect and motivate themselves to build their soft skills and confidence.
                    The name is a play on 'me' and 'committed'.</p>
                <p>CoMEtted involves <b>three components</b>, each offering a separate experience:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A smart mirror offering a reflection activity.</li>
                    <li>A motivational wall with encouraging quote projections providing a sense of community.</li>
                    <li>An app for long-term, personalised engagement, allowing users to set goals aligned with soft
                        skills and assign a buddy for accountability.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The mirror and the wall would be situated on educational campuses.</p>
                <p>Below is a screenshot of the systems map in FigJam, as well as the sketch of our first testable
                    concept, CoMEtted.</p>

                </div>
                <h5>End Stage: Design Principles and Final Concept</h5>
                <p>After <b>three rounds of user testing</b>, we arrived at our final design concept. This process
                    involved
                    several
                    iterations and a <b>name change</b>. User testing revealed confusion around the name 'CoMEtted',
                    especially
                    from international students, and this led to the more abstract name of <b>'terasu'</b>. Terasu means
                    'to shine' in Japanese and is inspired by the myth of the Japanese sun goddess,
                    <a href="https://naokoyogitakiguchi.medium.com/when-the-sun-goddess-hid-in-the-cave-of-heaven-a-medicine-story-from-japanese-creation-myths-30b166125c32"
                        target="_blank">Amaterasu</a>.
                </p>
                <p>terasu offers a <b>more simplified, purposeful</b> experience compared to CoMEtted. Instead of three
                    separate components, the wall of motivation and the mirror were combined into one installation.
                    Rather than
                    being a smart mirror, it now acts as a symbol for self-reflection. The app was adapted to involve
                    mentorship from industry professionals rather than a buddy for accountability. This resulted in two
                    apps, one for career starters and one for mentors. This concept is similar to Uber, which has
                    separate apps for drivers and passengers.</p>
                <p>Below are excerpts from our final report, highlighting the underpinning <b>design principles</b> of
                    terasu, as well as the <b>iterative process overview</b>:</p>

                <p>User testing was not just <b>vital</b> for the final outcome, but for the entire process. It enabled
                    us to
                    gain a <b>better understanding</b> of our target audience and their needs. It also <b>uncovered

                    we, as designers, were less likely to detect due to our own biases.</p>
                <h5>First Round</h5>
                <p>We tested a <b>low-fidelity</b> version of CoMEtted using a comprehensive <b>testing protocol</b>,
                    which
                    involved the think aloud method, interviewing, and a survey. Our analysis of the quantitative and

                <p>We tested a <b>mid-fidelity</b> version of terasu in a lecture theatre using projectors to mimic the
                    wall of
                    motivation. The improved fidelity of the prototype allowed for participants to feel more immersed in
                    the experience. While the second user testing round <b></b>showed clear improvements</b> from the
                    first round,
                    we <b>uncovered new problems</b>. These were more specific towards the transition from the physical
                    experience to the digital experience. Also, the app onboarding process was too long and still
                    included the
                    buddy system.</p>
                <p>The final user test involved a <b>heuristic evaluation</b> of the app, carried out by group member
                    Morgan.</p>

                <p>The final concept of terasu is presented in two parts - the physical installation experience in the
                    form of the wall of motivation and the two apps.</p>
                <h5>Physical Installation</h5>
                <p>I am primarily showcasing my contributions, which included the <b>3D concept renderings</b> of our
                    envisioned installation design. Despite being an artistic interpretation, the 3D environment and
                    models strongly helped communicate this vision to our peers and tutors. The ability to capture
                    different angles also came in handy for our <b>pitch video</b>.</p>

                <p>I created the 3D concepts with the help of the free and open-source software Blender and available 3D
                    models through Adobe Stock.</p>

                <p>While I took responsibility of the 3D concept work, my group members collaboratively handled the
                    design and prototyping of the two apps. Below is a mockup of the key screens for each app.</p>
